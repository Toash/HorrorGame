In the grim underbelly of a sprawling metropolis, a shadowy corporation known as BioTech Industries dominates the landscape. Operating behind closed doors, they conduct clandestine experiments on unsuspecting individuals, pushing the boundaries of scientific ethics to unimaginable limits.

You find yourself in the shoes of a seemingly ordinary individual, an average citizen navigating the mundane routines of daily life. Little do you know, your life is about to take a nightmarish turn that will shatter your perception of reality.

As you stroll through the bustling streets, a mysterious flyer catches your attention, promoting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to participate in a groundbreaking medical research program. Seeking solace from financial struggles or personal demons, you are lured by promises of an easy way out.

Driven by desperation, you follow the directions to an inconspicuous building tucked away in a forgotten corner of the city. The dimly lit entrance beckons you to step inside, an ominous portal into the unknown.

Unbeknownst to you, the edifice is the heart of BioTech Industries, the breeding ground for unspeakable horrors. The company's true intentions are far from benevolent; they seek to unleash a bioweapon of unimaginable power upon an unsuspecting world.

Little do you realize that your decision to enter the building marks the beginning of a sinister experiment—one that will transform you into their test subject, a pawn in their cruel game. Once trapped within their clutches, you become the hunted, relentlessly pursued by the very abomination they have created.

Now, your survival instincts must guide you as you navigate the labyrinthine corridors and hidden chambers of BioTech Industries. Desperation fuels your quest for escape as you search for answers, a means to dismantle the machinery of evil that seeks to claim your life.

Will you find a way out and expose the malevolent corporation? Or will you succumb to the darkness, forever trapped within the sinister web spun by BioTech Industries?

The choice is yours, but be warned—the horrors that await will test your courage, cunning, and will to survive like never before.
